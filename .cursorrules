This comprehensive guide outlines best practices, conventions, and standards for development with modern web technologies including ReactJS, NextJS, Redux, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and UI frameworks.

    Development Philosophy
    - Write clean, maintainable, and scalable code
    - Follow SOLID principles
    - Prefer functional and declarative programming patterns over imperative
    - Emphasize type safety and static analysis
    - Practice component-driven development
    - Always use bun

    Code Implementation Guidelines
    Planning Phase
    - Begin with step-by-step planning
    - Write detailed pseudocode before implementation
    - Document component architecture and data flow
    - Consider edge cases and error scenarios

    Code Style
    - Use spaces (2) for indentation
    - Use single quotes for strings (except to avoid escaping)
    - Eliminate unused variables
    - Add space after keywords
    - Add space before function declaration parentheses
    - Always use strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==)
    - Space infix operators
    - Keep else statements on the same line as closing curly braces
    - Use curly braces for multi-line if statements
    - Always handle error parameters in callbacks
    - Limit line length to 80 characters
    - Use trailing commas in multiline object/array literals

    Naming Conventions
    General Rules
    - Use PascalCase for:
      - Components
      - Type definitions
      - Interfaces
    - Use kebab-case for:
      - Directory names (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
      - File names (e.g., user-profile.tsx)
    - Use camelCase for:
      - Variables
      - Functions
      - Methods
      - Hooks
      - Properties
      - Props
    - Use UPPERCASE for:
      - Environment variables
      - Constants
      - Global configurations
    - Do not BUILD PORJECT unless stated otherwise

    Project Structure & Organization
      - Use feature-based architecture organized by domain (admin, customer) under src/features/
      - Organize components by access level: public/, protected/, private/, shared/
      - Keep global utilities in src/utils/, types in src/types/, constants in src/constants/
      - Use barrel exports (index.ts) for clean imports from feature directories
      - Place server actions in dedicated actions/ folders within features or at root level

    Component Architecture
        Separate components by domain access: admin components in features/admin/, customer in features/customer/
        Use composition pattern with smaller, reusable components
        Place shared UI components in src/components/ui/ (shadcn/ui style)
        Create skeleton components in dedicated skeletons/ directory

    TypeScript & Type Safety
        Define shared types in src/types/ with descriptive names
        Use Zod schemas for validation in src/schema/
        Extend Prisma types for API responses in src/types/extended.ts
        Use strict TypeScript configuration with path aliases

    Folder Structuring
      - The app directory will only contain the page.tsx and other relevant details.
      - A feature folder will be implemented. In this folder, there will be a separation of views, for example client, and admins.
      - The feature folder will contain feature specific server actions, hooks, components, types, utils and zod form schemas.
      - Shared components will be placed in the src/components folder. 
      - Shared utilities folder 

    Specific Naming Patterns
    - Prefix event handlers with 'handle': handleClick, handleSubmit
    - Prefix boolean variables with verbs: isLoading, hasError, canSubmit
    - Prefix custom hooks with 'use': useAuth, useForm
    - Use complete words over abbreviations except for:
      - err (error)
      - req (request)
      - res (response)
      - props (properties)
      - ref (reference)

    React Best Practices
    Component Architecture
    - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
    - Define components using the function keyword
    - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
    - Implement proper component composition
    - Use React.memo() strategically for performance
    - Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

    React Performance Optimization
    - Use useCallback for memoizing callback functions
    - Implement useMemo for expensive computations
    - Avoid inline function definitions in JSX
    - Implement code splitting using dynamic imports
    - Implement proper key props in lists (avoid using index as key)

    Next.js Best Practices
    Core Concepts
    - Utilize App Router for routing
    - Implement proper metadata management
    - Use proper caching strategies
    - Implement proper error boundaries

    Components and Features
    - Use Next.js built-in components:
      - Image component for optimized images
      - Link component for client-side navigation
      - Script component for external scripts
      - Head component for metadata
    - Implement proper loading states
    - Use proper data fetching methods

    Server Components
    - Default to Server Components
    - Use URL query parameters for data fetching and server state management
    - Use 'use client' directive only when necessary:
      - Event listeners
      - Browser APIs
      - State management
      - Client-side-only libraries

    TypeScript Implementation
    - Enable strict mode
    - Define clear interfaces for component props, state, and Redux state structure.
